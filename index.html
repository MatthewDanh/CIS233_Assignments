        <h2>Who is Glitch?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a student at Estrella Mountain Community College, working on an
          Associate of Applied Science degree in Computer Programming and
          Systems Analysis. I feel a strong sense of obligation to give back to
          the community, and I do it by volunteering with and writing for a
          local LGBT magazine and by supporting Arizona activism groups like
          Be-A-Hero. As soon as Be-A-Hero received its 501(c)(3) status, I
          joined the board of directors as the organization's education
          director. I've worked as a virtual instructor for StudyPool and
          contributed to a number of Wonder Client Research Reports during the
          course of my employment.

          As someone who has discovered many of their closest friends and most
          reliable sources of support via online platforms like Discord and
          Slack. My interest in the field of Cybersecurity and Data Privacy has
          grown into a true obsession. It might be difficult for members of
          marginalized groups to maintain their privacy while engaging in
          internet activities. As I go towards a career in computer science, I
          want to contribute to the advancement of programming and cybersecurity
          so that we may more securely expand our networks of mutual
          understanding.

            Below you will find some of the art that I produced while in ART 112
            Two-Dimensional-Design. I took that class thinking that it would be
            an easy A and it would fulfill a course requirement.

            Susanna Battin was my instructor and I had a very unexpected
            realization because of her class. I love design, and I am a
            designer. Her class changed my life and objectives as I work through
            my career path. She taught me how to not only analyze the vessel
            through which messages and media travel, but also to analyze the
            perspective from which that content was created.

              As the bathers stare at the turtle Matisse stared at the bathers.
              We studied how Matisse was observing the women bathers in the same
              way the women in the painting were observing the turtle. Who is
              creating the content we are consuming and from what perspective is
              it done. A male artist objectified women and then presented this
              work to the world. What would we think if the subjects were male?
              What message does this send?</q
