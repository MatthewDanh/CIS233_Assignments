          <h1>Who is Glitch?</h1>
          <p>
            I am a student at Estrella Mountain Community College, working on an
            Associate of Applied Science degree in Computer Programming and
            Systems Analysis. I feel a strong sense of obligation to give back
            to the community, and I do it by volunteering with and writing for a
            local LGBT magazine and by supporting Arizona activism groups like
            Be-A-Hero. As soon as Be-A-Hero received its 501(c)(3) status, I
            joined the board of directors as the organization's education
            director. I've worked as a virtual instructor for StudyPool and
            contributed to a number of Wonder Client Research Reports during the
            course of my employment.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            As someone who has discovered many of their closest friends and most
            reliable sources of support via online platforms like Discord and
            Slack. My interest in the field of Cybersecurity and Data Privacy
            has grown into a true obsession. It might be difficult for members
            of marginalized groups to maintain their privacy while engaging in
            internet activities. As I go towards a career in computer science, I
            want to contribute to the advancement of programming and
            cybersecurity so that we may more securely expand our networks of
            mutual understanding.

            <h3>Art Projects</h3>
            <p>
              Below you will find some of the art that I produced while in ART
              112 Two-Dimensional-Design. I took that class thinking that it
              would be an easy A and it would fulfill a course requirement.

            <p>
              Susanna Battin was my instructor and I had a very unexpected
              realization because of her class. I love design, and I am a
              designer. Her class changed my life and objectives as I work
              through my career path. She taught me how to not only analyze the
              vessel through which messages and media travel, but also to
              analyze the perspective from which that content was created.

                These are some of the projects that I completed as well as some
                digital logos that I created for my Discord server.I often try
                to consider what perspective am I presenting and is this
                something that the world needs or hasn't seen.
